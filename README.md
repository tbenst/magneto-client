# magneto-client

See the [Magneto Reference Manual](https://github.com/tbenst/magneto-client/blob/master/magneto/doc/magneto_quick_reference.pdf) for more information.

Based on the fantastic [Aenea](https://github.com/dictation-toolbox/aenea) and [Caster](https://github.com/synkarius/caster) libraries for voice-coding. Designed for Linux, tested with Ubuntu 16.04. Project is no-longer active, but many features have been since integrated into Caster.
